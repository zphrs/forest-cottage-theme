### Color Inspiration

Inspired by general colors found in foresty settings like green ðŸ’š, golden yellow ðŸ’›, orange ðŸ§¡, and purple ðŸ’œ. The purple ðŸ’œ is inspired by twitter's dark blue night theme background color, just hue shifted. The green ðŸ’š is another hue-shift of twitter's dark blue. The golden yellow is just a color that I enjoy in between yellow ðŸ’› and orange ðŸ§¡.
