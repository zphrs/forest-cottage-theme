### Color Inspiration for Classic

Inspired by general colors found in foresty settings like green 💚, golden yellow 💛, orange 🧡,
and purple 💜. The purple 💜 is inspired by twitter's dark blue night theme background color, just
hue shifted. The green 💚 is another hue-shift of twitter's dark blue. The golden yellow is just a
color that I enjoy in between yellow 💛 and orange 🧡.

### Color Inspiration for Classy

Similarly inspired by colors found in foresty settings, but more of a coastal forest inspiration
with seafoam green 🌊💚, golden yellow ⭐️💛, rusted red 🧱❤️, and moon-lit blueish purple 🌑💜

Colors were hand selected using [palettte.app](https://palettte.app) - you can find the palettte
JSON for import into palettte [here](./themes/palettteImport.json).
